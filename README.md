# Matrix Multiplication Benchmark
## Worked on by: Talha Hashmi, Wali, Ali, Faiz and Omar

This repository contains implementations of matrix multiplication in C++ with benchmarks for different matrix sizes (1000x1000, 4000x4000, 8000x8000, and 16000x16000) using three different approaches: sequential, OpenMP (omp), and CUDA.

Implementations

Sequential: The basic matrix multiplication algorithm implemented sequentially.
OpenMP (omp): Matrix multiplication parallelized using OpenMP to leverage multicore processors.
CUDA: Matrix multiplication implemented using CUDA for GPU acceleration.
